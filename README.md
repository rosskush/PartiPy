# Numerical methods to track particles in groundwater

(pronounced party pie) applies numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta and Euler's formula to track particles in modflow models using the cell budget file all within the python console.

partipy has the ability to allow the user to place starting coordinate locations in a modflow model and track the particles over time.

## Installation

`partipy` supports Python 3 

```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/rosskush/partipy.git
    $ cd partipy
    $ python setup.py install
```

partipy relies heavly on flopy which can be installed here:
https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy
or if you have pip

```bash
  $ pip install flopy
```
